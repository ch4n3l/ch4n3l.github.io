## i. Port Scan

Due to the machine displaying it's IP Address, I'm going to skip using netdiscover.

Running a port scan using unicornscan:

~~~
$ unicornscan -i eth0 Ir 160 10.0.2.9

-i = interface name
-I = immediately display results as they are found
-r = rate of packets to send per second

## ii. Enumeration

Starting with port 80, we will use a web browser to browse to the host.

We are presented with a web page showing that this is a blog. Checking the pages, we can see that they end in .html, so PHP does not seem to be installed on this webserver.

Now to search for any hidden directories/pages and any files that end with .html & .txt.

~~~
$ gobuster -u http://10.0.2.9 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 25 -x txt,html

-u = url
-w = wordlist to use
-t = threads
-x = file extensions

Gobuster has found an /admin directory. Navigating to /admin, we see notes.txt:

notes.txt:
~~~
Note to myself : 

I need to change my password :/ 12345ted123 is too outdated but the technology isn't my thing i prefer go fishing or watching soccer .
~~~

Putting two-and-two together, a possible username for the password is ted (as ted is in the password string)

As we saw earlier, SSH is open. So we can try using ted:12345ted123 with SSH.

Great, we got a user.

## iii. Privilege Escalation

First thing I like to do when obtaining low privilege access is enumerating some information about our user.

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2017/toppo/userenum.png)

~~~
$ id; sudo -l

id - displays information about our user, such as what groups they are in.
sudo -l  - displays if we can run any commands as sudo
~~~

So it seems like sudo is missing. To confirm it's not a PATH issue, I'll check if our $PATH is correct, and if sudo is installed.

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2017/toppo/sudo.png)

~~~
$ echo $PATH
- Displays the PATH environment variable which stores directories in which executable files live.

$ dpkg -l | grep sudo
- Lists installed packages on the system, while `grep sudo` filters out the packages to look for sudo.
~~~

Seems like sudo is missing from the system. Interestingly enough, /etc/sudoers file exists.
